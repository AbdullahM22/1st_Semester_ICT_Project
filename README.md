# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows a player to play against the computer and follows the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe.

## How to Play

1. Run the `Tic_Tac_Toe.py` script to start the game.
2. And add two files `Grid.py` & `Toss.py` as they are further used to import functionality as module's which are used for creating grid and making toss.
3. The game will prompt the player to enter their name and choose a symbol (either 'X' or 'O').
4. A toss will decide which player goes first - the player or the computer.
5. Players will take turns making their moves by entering the number corresponding to the cell they want to place their symbol.
6. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
7. If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
